# Generative Artificial Intelligence with OpenAI

### Code and slides to accompany the online series of webinars: https://data4sci.com/OpenAI by Data For Science.

### Run the code in Binder: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/DataForScience/OpenAI/master)

OpenAI is the current leader in publicly available AI models, with state-of-the-art tools like ChatGPT, Codex, and Dall-E being accessible to everyone online. OpenAI also provides powerful and modular APIs that allow programmers to leverage the functionality of these models directly into their applications.

In this workshop, we will introduce the main concepts behind this class of models and how their functionality is published through the API. We will combine the tools provided by OpenAI to answer questions on a topic with ChatGPT, generate image variations from a text prompt with DALL-E, create a textual description of an image, and generate code from a prompt.
